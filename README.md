- **Dynamic Parkour Animations**: Different parkour animations are triggered based on the height of the player’s character, such as jumping, sliding, vaulting, and more.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animations transition seamlessly based on player movement, height, and obstacle interactions.
- **Parkour Mechanic**: The player can perform various parkour actions, such as jumping over obstacles, sliding under barriers, and vaulting over higher obstacles.
